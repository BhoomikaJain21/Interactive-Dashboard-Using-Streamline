# Interactive Data Dashboard using Streamlit

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project is an independently developed, interactive web dashboard built in Python using the Streamlit framework. The primary objective was to gain practical proficiency in integrating key Data Science libraries—**Pandas** for robust data cleaning and manipulation, and **Matplotlib** for creating clear, informative visualizations—and deploying them within an accessible, user-friendly application environment provided by Streamlit.

## 💡 Key Features

* **Interactive Filters:** Implements user controls (e.g., date sliders, dropdowns) to dynamically filter and analyze the underlying dataset.
* **Dynamic Visualizations:** Generates and displays custom charts (bar charts, line plots) that update in real-time based on user input, enhancing exploratory data analysis.
* **Data Summarization:** Utilizes Pandas to calculate and display key summary statistics and data overviews.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web interface and deployment.
* **Pandas:** For efficient data loading, cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
* **Matplotlib:** For generating high-quality, customized data visualizations.
